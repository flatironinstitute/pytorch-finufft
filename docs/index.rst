Pytorch-FINUFFT
===============

This package provides a `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ interface to the
`Flatiron Institute Non-uniform FFT (FINUFFT) <https://finufft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
library.

Currently, this supports both forward evaluation and backward differentiation in
both values and positions for the :external+finufft:doc:`"type 1" and "type 2" <math>` transforms.
